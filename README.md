# CPL

Solutions for the exercises in the book [**Essentials of Programming Languages**](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1378240&coll=DL&dl=GUIDE&CFID=472644417&CFTOKEN=48425312), which is used for the course [Comparative Programming Languages (B-KUL-H0S01A)](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H0S01AE.htm). 

All the solutions to the exercises will be implemented in the [eopl](http://docs.racket-lang.org/eopl/) scheme dialect supported by the [Dr.Racket programming environment](http://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/). 

As additional resource you can visit [this](https://github.com/chenyukang/eopl/) repository which has (most of) them implemented in a different dialect.
